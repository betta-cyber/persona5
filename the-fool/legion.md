这里恶灵军团的这段典故来源于《路加福音》第八章中的26-39，

> 26 They sailed to the region of the Gerasenes,\[[a](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//www.biblegateway.com/passage/%3Fsearch%3DMark%2B5%253A1-20%252CLuke%2B8%253A26-39%26version%3DNIV%23fen-NIV-25272a)\] which is across the lake from Galilee.  
> 27 When Jesus stepped ashore, he was met by a demon-possessed man from the town. For a long time this man had not worn clothes or lived in a house, but had lived in the tombs.  
> 28 When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell at his feet, shouting at the top of his voice, “What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, don’t torture me!”  
> 29 For Jesus had commanded the impure spirit to come out of the man. Many times it had seized him, and though he was chained hand and foot and kept under guard, he had broken his chains and had been driven by the demon into solitary places.  
> 30 Jesus asked him, “What is your name?”Legion,” he replied, because many demons had gone into him.  
> 31 And they begged Jesus repeatedly not to order them to go into the Abyss.  
> 32 A large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside. The demons begged Jesus to let them go into the pigs, and he gave them permission. 33 When the demons came out of the man, they went into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned.  
> 34 When those tending the pigs saw what had happened, they ran off and reported this in the town and countryside,  
> 35 and the people went out to see what had happened. When they came to Jesus, they found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at Jesus’ feet, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.  
> 36 Those who had seen it told the people how the demon-possessedman had been cured.  
> 37 Then all the people of the region of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to leave them, because they were overcome with fear. So he got into the boat and left.  
> 38 The man from whom the demons had gone out begged to go with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying,  
> 39 “Return home and tell how much God has done for you.” So the man went away and told all over town how much Jesus had done for him.

主要讲的就是耶稣来到一个镇上，镇上有一个被鬼魂附身的人迎面就过来找耶稣。这个人吧，他也不穿衣服，也不住在房子里，偏偏要住在坟墓里。他见了耶稣，就俯伏在他面前，大声喊叫：“至高神的儿子-耶稣，求你不要叫我受苦啊！”。耶稣问他嘛：你叫什么？他说：我叫Legion，之所以这样是因为附着他身上的鬼太多了。希望能帮助自己。然后那些鬼魂就很害怕，祈求耶稣不要把自己遣送到地狱。正好这个时候有一大群猪在那儿，他们就请求耶稣进入到猪的身体里面，耶稣同意了。于是那些鬼魂就从那人身体里出来了，进入猪里去。但是那群猪闯下山崖，投在湖里淹死了。放猪的看见这事就跑了，去告诉镇上的人。众人出来要看到底是什么事，到了耶稣这里，看见了Legion，坐在耶稣脚前，穿着衣服，心里就明白过来了，他们就害怕。这件事一下子就传开了。然后耶稣的同伴也很害怕，请求耶稣离开他。耶稣就上船回去了。Legion就恳求和耶稣同在。耶稣却打发他回去，说：“你回家去，告诉别人神为你做了多么伟大的一件事就好了，没必要害怕。”他就回去满城里传扬耶稣的功德。

这里的恶灵军团在被耶稣解救前确实是有点恶心了，不过还好，作为一个persona，我基本都不会去收服这个的，真的太丑太丑了。
